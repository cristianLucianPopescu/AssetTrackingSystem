Asset Tracking System is a software that tracks details about any device on a network.
The details are from device's name and manufacturer until ip and mac addresses.
All these details are stored in a database which can be manipulated by an admin (view, add, edit, delete and back up) through The Asset Tracking System program.
The software also gives the posibility to search for vulnerabilities into the NVD database.
Asset Tracking System only runs on Windows OS.

This guide is a step-by-step learning tool on how to use the Asset Tracking System. Before starting the software, the two databases found in the Database folder (TrackMe\TrackMe\Database) must be copied in local storage -> C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\FC4F554F-D761-4D38-A4F9-74849D3F5EF4_cm1s7pp5eggww\LocalState where USERNAME is your windows user name. This action must be done before starting the application, otherwise the system would not be aware of any databases and some functions would not work. The program has a navigation at the top left which is very familiar to a website navigation bar so should be very user friendly. When the user uses the functions as add, update, or delete a record from the database, in order to see the change, he has to go to Main Page, where the displayed asset records can be located.

1 Login

When the user wants to run the Asset Tracking System, it will be prompted to enter his credentials(admin->Administrator1. or user->Username2.). In case he makes a typing mistake, an error message will be displayed, and the user will have to try again until the details entered will be validated.

2 Main

Once the user is logged in successfully, the landing page is the Main Page where it can be found the displayed records from both asset databases, hardware, and software.

3 Backup The Databases

On Main Page, there is also a Backup button which once actioned it will save the last modified database or both, if there were alterations in both databases. In case that there are not any changes to the records, then the button does nothing.

4 Add A Record

The Add Page displays input boxes for user to fill in with details of records. Once all the boxes are filled, the Add button at the bottom of the page must be clicked in order for the record to be added to the database.

5 Update A Record

On the Update Page, there is a search box where the user has to write the name of the asset he wants to modify. Once the Search button is actioned, the text boxes bellow will be updated with the details of the record the user looked up. Now all is left to do is to edit what details has to be changed and hit the Save button.

6 Delete A Record

Same as on the Update Page, there is a search utility on the Delete Page as well but once the Delete button is clicked the asset name record inserted will be erased from the database.

7 Search For A Vulnerability

This page has a search function where the user can look up for vulnerabilities related to the asset name filled in the search box. After the Search button is pressed, the page will be populated with details from the National Vulnerability Database.

8 Exit Program

To close the program, the user must go to the top right corner and hit the “X”. Once this action is done, the user session is closed and if he wants to get back in, he has to fill his username and password again to obtain access to the system.
